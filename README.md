# Personal Website for Jackson McNabb.

This project was bootstrapped with [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Dependencies
I used [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for some front-end components and designing. For icons, I used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).



I used [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) for deployment.

To design the site, I used a simple wireframe before coding, seen here: [Wireframe](https://wireframe.cc/cQFwMx):

### Todos:
- fix order of projects by end date or separate professional and academic projects.
- links on top of sections (done on skills). Add section header styling, like underlining. 
- favicon not in build
- mobile skill section is off the page for some sizes
- add card borders?
