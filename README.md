# Personal Website for Jackson McNabb

This project was bootstrapped with [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Dependencies
I used [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for some front-end components and designing. For icons, I used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

I used [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) for deployment.

### Future Ideas
- add burger menu for the nav pane (on mobile)
- add scaling/hidden image for all experience cards

To design the site, I created a simple wireframe, seen here: [Wireframe](https://wireframe.cc/cQFwMx):
