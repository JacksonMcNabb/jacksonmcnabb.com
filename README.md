# Personal Website for Jackson McNabb.

This project was bootstrapped with [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Dependencies
I used [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for some front-end components and designing. For icons, I used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

I used [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) for deployment.

### Todos:
- mobile skill section is off the page for some sizes
- bolding on nav pane jitters when scaled up on some browser versions (smooth flexbox doesn't work)
- when highlighting cards, only the title should change color
- add burger menu for the nav pane?
To design the site, I created a simple wireframe, seen here: [Wireframe](https://wireframe.cc/cQFwMx):
